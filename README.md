### What I learned

I used React JS and Tailwind to build this process. I used react basics and react hooks such as useState in this project. Building the responsive navbar was a bit tricky but after watching some youtube videos I figured it out. During this project I focused majorly on adding responsiveness to my website.

### Useful resources

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/responsive-design) - This is an amazing article which helped me in adding responsiveness
